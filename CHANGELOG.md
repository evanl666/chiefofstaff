# Changelog

## 0.1.9 (2026-11-03)

- **Sessions learn from your feedback**: your decisions, review comments, follow-ups, retry and
  cancel notes and draft edits become lessons ("Give every migration a rollback"). You keep,
  reword or drop each on a card; only kept ones reach your sessions. Settings lists them and
  shows how often you now take recommendations, send drafts as written and accept results.
- A worker about to ask something you decided before is told your earlier decision first;
  the card shows it too.
- Usage counts what workers used while open in a terminal, including before Chief of Staff was
  running.
- A worker working in a terminal shows under Running. An adopted session's placeholder task no
  longer shows as finished work.
- The inbox's reply strip no longer shows a stray "null".

## 0.1.8 (2026-11-03)

- **Acceptance criteria**: tasks get *done when* checks, and the worker reports each one with
  evidence. The review card marks each as verified (a command it was seen running backs it),
  claimed, not met or not checked, with one verdict for the task. A test that failed and then
  passed shows as *✗→✓*.
- **Evidence is about one version of the code**: the card shows the commit it was checked at,
  and says *Out of date* once the code or a decision it relied on changes.
- **Decision cards**: a worker asks for a decision with why it comes up, the options and their
  effects, and its recommendation. Workers that hit the same question share one card.
- **Change a decision and the work follows**: tell the Router; every task that relied on it is
  told, finished results reopen, and a card shows the impact until each worker confirms.
- A task can wait for another's accepted result instead of its reported one.

## 0.1.7 (2026-11-03)

- Timelines are easier to read: what a session says on the way to its next steps is folded into
  the line of steps, so its answers and reports stand out.
- **Message one of your other Copilot sessions to continue it here.** It becomes a worker with
  its conversation so far and keeps working in its own folder.
- A session open in a terminal says so where the message box would be, instead of a box you
  cannot type in.
- What a worker did in a terminal shows in its timeline, also when Chief of Staff was started
  later or not running then. Long session logs show their latest messages.
- A message straight to a worker whose task was done brings its next result back for review.

## 0.1.6 (2026-11-02)

- **Review a task's changes**: click *+N −M in K files* on a review card for its diff, comment on
  lines, and send the comments to the worker as one follow-up.
- **Create PR** on a review card pushes the worker's branch and opens a pull request with the
  task's report. The worker follows it, and the task is marked done when it is merged.
- New worktrees get the gitignored files they need: `.env` and `.env.*` by default, or what a
  `.worktreeinclude` file lists. Workers are told to install dependencies in a fresh worktree.
- A closed worker's changes still show in its receipts after its worktree is removed.

## 0.1.5 (2026-11-02)

- Opening one of your other Copilot sessions works again, and shows its latest conversation,
  read-only, current while it works in a terminal.
- A worker you open in a terminal is mirrored read-only from Copilot's own log: its messages
  and steps, and whether it is working. The Watchdog and idle closing leave it alone.
- The demo includes a session open in a terminal.

## 0.1.4 (2026-11-02)

- **One code folder** (like `~/workspace`) instead of listing projects: every repository in it
  is a project, and a repository a task needs that is not there is cloned into it once.
- Each worker's own folder is in `.chief/` inside the code folder, with a git worktree of each
  repository it changes. When a worker closes, its clean worktrees are removed (the branches
  stay); reopening it brings them back.
- A repository already on this machine is reused instead of cloned again.
- Settings: *Code folder* at the top; *Other project folders* and *Task folders* under
  Advanced.

## 0.1.3 (2026-11-02)

- Starting Chief of Staff while it is already running opens the running one, instead of an
  error.
- Ctrl+C stops it at once, without a traceback, even with the page open.

## 0.1.2 (2026-11-02)

- Sessions open in a terminal get their own mark, a blue ring, instead of the green of finished
  work. Every sidebar dot says what it means on hover.
- The *Add a project folder* card has *Not now*, for working without projects.

## 0.1.1 (2026-11-02)

- *Other Copilot sessions* marks the ones open in a terminal right now and lists them first.
- Handing a session over to the Router brings its conversation along, and is refused while it
  is open in a terminal. Chief of Staff never resumes a session another Copilot window has
  open.
- Sessions handed over before tasks existed no longer show as running.

## 0.1.0 (2026-11-02)

First public release.

- **Router** that splits requests into tasks, routes follow-ups to the worker that already
  knows the subject, and asks you when it is unsure which project a task belongs to.
- **Tasks and runs**: dependencies, reports, retries, cancellation and usage per task.
- **Inbox**: what needs you, what is running, and results ready to review with **receipts**
  (observed test runs, changes, commits and PR checks next to what the worker reported).
- **Focus Shield**: notifications wait while you focus; one summary afterwards.
- **Delegate by reaction**: react 🤖 to any Slack message to turn it into a task, answered
  in its thread when done.
- **Slack and GitHub**: replies and PR reviews drafted in your voice, sent only after you
  approve; followed threads and PRs go straight to their worker.
- **Watchdog** that notices stalled or looping workers and nudges them.
- **Sandboxed workers** (Copilot's OS sandbox): writes only to their own folders, no access to
  your keys, GitHub credentials through a proxy.
- **Reliable delivery**: interrupted sends and drafts are checked before anything is resent.
- **Demo mode** (`chiefofstaff --demo`): the whole product without any account.
