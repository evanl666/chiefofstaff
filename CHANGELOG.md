# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

First public release.

- **Router** that splits requests into tasks, routes follow-ups to the worker that already
  knows the subject, and asks you when it is unsure which project a task belongs to.
- **Tasks and runs**: dependencies, reports, retries, cancellation and usage per task.
- **Inbox**: what needs you, what is running, and results ready to review with **receipts**
  (observed test runs, changes, commits and PR checks next to what the worker reported).
- **Focus Shield**: notifications wait while you focus; one summary afterwards.
- **Delegate by reaction**: react 🤖 to any Slack message to turn it into a task, answered
  in its thread when done.
- **Slack and GitHub**: replies and PR reviews drafted in your voice, sent only after you
  approve; followed threads and PRs go straight to their worker.
- **Watchdog** that notices stalled or looping workers and nudges them.
- **Sandboxed workers** (Copilot's OS sandbox): writes only to their own folders, no access to
  your keys, GitHub credentials through a proxy.
- **Reliable delivery**: interrupted sends and drafts are checked before anything is resent.
- **Demo mode** (`chiefofstaff --demo`): the whole product without any account.
